# DigiComp 3.0 - The Digital Competence Framework for Citizens

This repository contains the DigiComp2.2 Competence Framework according to Cosgrove et al. (2025). The competence descriptions as well as the competence areas and dimensions have been extracted from the original publication and have been put into a json structure (see Overview below).

## Abstract (Taken directly from the [Framework Website](https://publications.jrc.ec.europa.eu/repository/handle/JRC144121))

DigComp 3.0 is the fifth edition of the European Digital Competence Framework for Citizens. It describes knowledge, skills and attitudes that are needed to be digitally competent for daily life, participation in society, working and learning. The framework is technology-neutral and is designed to be tailored and adapted for a variety of purposes in education, training and employment contexts. The framework update reflects rapid digital technological developments that have occurred since 2022 and which have wide-ranging implications for digital competence. DigComp 3.0 includes new learning outcomes which provide a more granular view of digital competence than previously, as well as the systematic and transversal integration of AI across the framework. It supports EU policies and initiatives on digital skills (such as the Union of Skills and the Digital Decade Policy Programme) and the societal and economic implications of the digital transformation (such as the AI Continent Action Plan and the European Strategy for a Better Internet for Kids). It is intended for individuals and organisations, whether local, regional, national, European or international, who share the common goal of understanding and identifying digital skills needs and supporting their development.

## Word Count

The number of tokens needed to process your JSON document depends on its length and structure. Tokens are not characters or words, but small units (like word parts, punctuation, or brackets) that text is broken into.

* **Competence Framework:** 1345 words (ca. 1749 tokens)
* **Proficiency Levels:** 198 words (ca. 260 tokens)

For the Llama 3.1 8B model, the maximum context window is 128,000 tokens, but the default context size depends on how it’s deployed. Default in most frameworks:

* Typically 4,096 tokens (4K) or sometimes 8,192 tokens (8K).
* This is the “out‑of‑the‑box” setting chosen to balance performance and resource usage.
